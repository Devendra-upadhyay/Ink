      <h2>Devendra Upadhyaya</h2>
      <div class="role">Hindi Poet · Writer · Observer</div>
      <p>
      My name is Devendra Upadhyay.  
      I am a Hindi poet and writer who believes that words are not always meant
      to speak loudly — some exist to sit quietly with the reader.
    </p>

    <p>
      I began writing as a way to give direction to sleepless thoughts and
      unspoken emotions. Over time, writing became not just an expression,
      but a process of understanding myself and the world around me.
    </p>

    <p>
      My work is rooted in Hindi literature and shaped by introspection,
      everyday emotions, social observations, and the subtle struggles of life.
      I write about distance, longing, time, memories, family, and silence.
    </p>

    <p>
      Though academically trained in Computer Science and Engineering,
      my creative identity has always leaned toward words.
      Writing helped me transform restless nights into reflection
      and confusion into clarity.
    </p>

    <p>
      For me, poetry is not decoration.
      It is reflection.
      It is honesty.
      It is silence, given a voice.
    </p>

  <!-- WHY I WRITE -->

    <h2>Why I Write</h2>
    <div class="quote-box">
      <div class="quote-divider">• • •</div>
      I write because some emotions refuse to stay quiet.
    Because silence often carries more truth than noise.
    Because words allow me to pause, observe, and understand.

    <br><br>

    Every poem is an attempt to listen —
    to myself, and to the world around me.
