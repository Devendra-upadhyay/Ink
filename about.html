    <div class="about-text">
      <p>
        My name is Devendra Upadhyay. I am a Hindi poet and writer who believes that words are not always meant to speak loudly — some exist to sit quietly with the reader.
      </p>

      <p>
        I began writing as a way to give direction to sleepless thoughts and unspoken emotions. Over time, writing became not just an expression, but a process of understanding myself and the world around me.
      </p>

      <p>
        My work is rooted in Hindi literature and shaped by introspection, everyday emotions, social observations, and the subtle struggles of life. I write about distance, longing, time, memories, family, and silence.
      </p>

      <p>
        Though academically trained in Computer Science and Engineering, my creative identity has always leaned toward words. Writing helped me transform restless nights into reflection and confusion into clarity.
      </p>

      <p class="emphasis">
        Poetry is not decoration. <br>
        It is reflection. <br>
        It is honesty. <br>
        It is silence, given a voice.
